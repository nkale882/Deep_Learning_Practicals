# Deep_Learning_Practicals

Welcome to my curated collection of Deep Learning practicals implemented using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**,**PyTorch** and **Google Colab**. This repository demonstrates a wide range of real-world applications including binary and multiclass image classification, transfer learning, and time series forecasting.

Each notebook includes:
- Dataset preprocessing and visualization
- Model architecture definition
- Training and validation
- Performance evaluation
- Inference on new data (where applicable)
